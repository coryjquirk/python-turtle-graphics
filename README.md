# python-turtle-graphics  
Basic drawings made with Python's Turtle module.  
## how to use  
to use `turtle` you must have [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html#module-tkinter) installed.  
one way to insatll tkinter: 
* open your Python 3 shell and write  
``>>> import tkinter``  
``>>> tkinter._test()``
* once you see a 'test' window like this, you know tkinter is displaying graphics properly.
