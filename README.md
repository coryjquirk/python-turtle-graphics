# python-turtle-graphics  
A collection of drawings made with Python's Turtle module.  

## how to use  
to use the `turtle` module imported in each example's code, you must install [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html#module-tkinter).  
one way to install tkinter: 
* open your Python 3 shell and write  
``>>> import tkinter``  
``>>> tkinter._test()``
* once you see a 'test' window like this, you know tkinter is displaying graphics properly.
* from there, run the file and enjoy.
